# Ruby Calculator Docker Project

This project is a simple Ruby-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) with user input. The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to run in any environment.

## Files

- `calculator.rb`: Ruby script that prompts the user for two numbers and an operator, then calculates and prints the result.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration file to build and run the application.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.
